## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

Hi there, my name is Aras GÃ¼ngÃ¶re.

Iâ€™m a graduate of the University of North Texas with a masterâ€™s degree in Advanced Data Analytics with a focus on Deep Learning and AI. I also hold another master's degree in Data Science and a bachelor's degree in Applied Arts and Sciences from the same institution. I spent a majority of my undergraduate journey at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City Community College pursuing Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry. My academic journey seamlessly integrates computer science and engineering, providing me with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, software development, and AI systems - all areas that align with my personal interests. This combination of skills allows me to design, build, and deploy innovative solutions that bridge intricate technological gaps and address ciritcal business problems.

I currently work as an impact-oriented Data Scientist for the State of Oklahoma at the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES). Working for a centralized State government data/IT department has allowed me to gain valuable experience in all facets of the data science and computer science fields. My current role focuses on developing and deploying general machine learning models like: decision trees, random forest, XGBoost, SVM, Kmeans, and KNN models to deep learning models like: ANN, CNN, RNN, LLM, SLM and NLP models. My role has also allowed me to become the subject matter expert in artificial intellegence (AI) for the State of Oklahoma and I was appointed to the Governor's AI Task Force as a technical resource. I have gained valuable executive leadership and presentation skills. In my previous roles, Iâ€™ve used my technical expertise and collaboration skills to contribute to significant projects in AI systems, end-to-end data models, and software development. My experiences demonstrate my ability to navigate complex challenges and drive interdisciplinary projects. With a passion for technology and a versatile skill set, Iâ€™m well-positioned to make lasting contributions through innovation and collaboration.
